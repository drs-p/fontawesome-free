\section{Introduction}
There are several packages on CTAN that provide access to the free \emph{Font Awesome} icons, but these have become outdated and are missing many icons from newer versions of Font Awesome.
The \textsf{\jobname} package attempts to deal with the update problem by building the \hologo{LaTeX} support dynamically from data in the fonts themselves;
updating the package is then as simple as replacing the font files with newer ones.
The drawback of this approach is that the package only works with \hologo{LuaLaTeX}.


\section{Installation}
This package is not (yet?) available from CTAN, so it must be installed manually;
this is done by copying the contents of the \texttt{texmf/} directory to either your \texttt{\$TEXMFLOCAL} or your \texttt{\$TEXMFHOME} tree.
Installing it in \texttt{\$TEXMFLOCAL} will make the package available to all users on the system, but may require administrator rights;
installing it in \texttt{\$TEXMFHOME} makes it available only for you.
The exact values of \texttt{\$TEXMFLOCAL} and \texttt{\$TEXMFHOME} depend on your TeX installation; see your installation's documentation for more information.

\pagebreak[2]
If you are using TeX Live, you can find the value of these variables by running
\begin{center}
    \verb|kpsewhich -expand-var '$TEXMFLOCAL'|
\end{center}
and similarly for \texttt{\$TEXMFHOME}.


\section{Usage}
The \textsf{\jobname} package contains all icons from the free subset of the Font Awesome fonts.
\DescribeMacro{\fa}The package provides one command, \cs{fa}, with a single mandatory argument: the \meta{name} of the icon.

Some icons have light or open variants, such as \fa{face-smile-o} and \fa{face-smile}.
Those variants are accessed by adding \texttt{-o} to the icon name: \verb|\fa{face-smile-o}| instead of \verb|\fa{face-smile}|.
A list of all icons and their names is included in the appendices.

By default, the Font Awesome icons have varying widths.
\DescribeMacro{\fa*}The \cs{fa} command has a starred variant \cs{fa*} that produces fixed-width icons, by centering them in a 1.25em wide box.
