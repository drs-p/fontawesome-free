\begin{abstract}
    There are several packages on CTAN that provide access to the free \emph{Font Awesome} icons, but these have all become outdated and are missing many icons from newer versions of Font Awesome.
    The \textsf{\jobname} package deals with this problem by building the \hologo{LaTeX} support dynamically from data in the fonts themselves; updating the package is as simple as replacing the font files with newer ones \fa{thumbs-up-o}. The drawback of this approach is that the package only works with \hologo{LuaLaTeX} \fa{face-frown-o}.
\end{abstract}

\section{Usage}
The \textsf{\jobname} package contains all 2,050 icons from the free subset of the Font Awesome fonts. \DescribeMacro{\fa}The package provides one command, \cs{fa}, with a single mandatory argument: the \meta{name} of the icon. Some icons have light or ``open'' variants, like \fa{file-pdf-o} versus \fa{file-pdf}. Those variants are accessed by adding \texttt{-o} to the icon name: \verb|\fa{file-pdf-o}| versus \verb|\fa{file-pdf}|. A full list of icons and their names is included in the appendices.

By default, the Font Awesome icons have varying widths. \DescribeMacro{\fa*}The \cs{fa} command has a starred variant \cs{fa*} that produces fixed-width icons, by centering them in a 1.25em wide box.
